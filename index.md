**Hello! Welcome to my website!** 

I made it to create a **more personal and detailed** approach of my profile, in **complement** of a classic CV or cover letter. 

It will maybe be used for other purposes, such as a memo, a portfolio for finding musicians, or for volunteering for example. Life is too short to be tidy! 

Summary : 

- I love **biology** !
- I love **IT** !
- I want to fuse both !!!!

My main possibilities are :

- Becoming a **cross-field** engineer
    - Do research
    - Work in a company
- Becoming **entrepreneur**
- Becoming a doctor ???
- Becoming a rockstar drummer ????? (in my dreams)

To achieve the first option, I have to make experience as a junior developer. 

My main worry is to have really slow and boring first experiences that would make me fed up about developing. 

My ideal job involves to be given an interesting, challenging mission and to be surrounded by a trustworthy team.

My even-more-ideal job would be this and working directly in a life sciences or health field.

The job of my wildest, sleep-deprived, mint-tea-fueled dreams would have infinite snacks, hammocks, music practice room and lasergames. But I think Iâ€™m getting lost.
