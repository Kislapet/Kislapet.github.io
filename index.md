**Hello! Welcome to my website!** 

I created it to offer a **more personal and detailed** view of my profile, in order to complement a classic CV or cover letter.

Maybe it will also be used for other things, like a memo, a portfolio to find musicians, or for volunteering, just to name a few. Life is too short to keep things too tidy!

Summary : 

- I love **biology** !
- I love **information technologies** !
- I want to bridge both !!!!

My main possibilities are :

- Becoming a **cross-field** engineer
    - Do research
    - Work in a company
- Becoming **entrepreneur**
- Becoming a doctor (GP)???
- Becoming a rockstar drummer ????? (in my dreams)

To achieve the first option, I have to gain experience as a junior software developer. 

My main concern is that if my first few experiences are too slow or boring, I might lose interest in software engineering.

My ideal job involves being given an interesting, challenging mission and being surrounded by a trustworthy team.

My even more ideal job would combine this with working directly in the life sciences or health field.

The job of my wildest, sleep-deprived, mint-tea-fueled dreams would have infinite snacks, hammocks, a music practice room, and laser tag. But I think I'm getting a bit carried away.
