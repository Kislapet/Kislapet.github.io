Favorite projects have a little emoji heart (❤) on them

## Owls Worst Nightmare : Final engineering project ❤

Research & development mainly with Python

Final internship project where I created a video processing tool to enhance consumers quality of experience.
<details>
<summary>Read more...</summary>
<br>    
The videos were optimized using FFMPEG, for example the sound was normalized. The orientation of the videos are detected using a simple Resnet-18 model made from scratch, and the subtitles are generated by a fine-tuned instance of a Whisper-tiny model. 
    
Videos were managed via Redis, as a light broker, and with Azure Function Apps and storages.
    
A Make automation makes a call to an Azure function app when a new video arrives from VideoAsk.

## Ouch My Toe : Simple appointment scheduling API

A complete API made for making, modifying/seeing or deleting appointments. A PostgreSQL database stocks the appointments title, date, status, location, etc. Data is validated with Pydantic.

## Just Stick The Password On The Computer : Serious Game for cybersecurity in hospitals ❤

Making of a multi-player game in Gamemaker using Python, to raise awareness about good cybersecurity practices in hospital.

After I made the game crash and corrupt our backup-less file by trying to implement a mini-quiz, we mutually agreed to let me manage the game design and graphics instead.

## French Public Hospitals On Windows XP: Building a RIS

Implement a Radiology Information System to manage patients data, resources, medical examination reports, statistics... For the graphical part, welcome back to 2005.

<details>
<summary>Read more...</summary>
<br>

I used ThaiRIS open source project as our RIS. I had to connect it to a PACS (Picture Archieving and Communicating System that uses DICOM norms) and to a visualization system, but we didn’t manage to connect them in time.

## Burp : Non-invasive GERD detection for babies ❤

Engineering project with minimal supervision. Brainstorming for the original idea, and project implementation following agile methods.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is due to a dysfunction of the cardia , the upper sphincter closing the stomach. In cases of reflux, stomach acid can rise up to the mouth, leading to discomfort or a burning sensation. 

<details>

<br>
    
Babies suffering from GERD can be treated over a short period with medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antacids, and prokinetic drugs. These have some secondary effects : nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain…

    Accelerometer actual picture, and schematic representations.
    
A mechanical and simple treatment is to elevate the head of the bed by 30°, but has to be watched carefully because of the risks of newborn sudden death.
    
The project was to use a small accelerometer as a non-invasive method to detect movement in the lower esophagus part, thus detecting acidic reflux AND non-acidic reflux (an innovation !!! Wow !!!)
    
![The sensor would be placed on the subxiphoid process…](../assets/images/projects/Image2.png)

    …on the baby’s torso.
    
The signal is processed, and when an acceleration is detected, the bed elevates for a short period of time, and then goes back to its original position. A mobile application receives a notification to alert the parents. They can choose to disable the automatic mode, or to customize it.
